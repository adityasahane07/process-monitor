# process-monitor

ProcessMonitor is a Python automation script designed to monitor and log running processes on your system. It periodically records information about active processes, including their PID, name, and memory usage, and saves this data to a log file. Additionally, ProcessMonitor can automatically send the generated log file via email to a specified recipient. It offers flexibility by allowing users to specify the time interval for logging processes, making it a versatile tool for system monitoring and management.
